Experiment
Average Fitness Value for Each Grid (5 runs)
The population size 10000 gives the best results.
Therefore the larger the population size, the better the results yield.
The EA improves with increasing runs.
From the results, grid 3 is the hardest to solve, and grid 2 the
easiest caused by the amount of information each specific grid gives. With less information, 
the harder for the algorithm to find an optimal solution.

Future improvements:
Change amount of generations ran, as well as the truncation rate of the chromosomes. 
Use more complex crossovers or mutations, such as a N-crossover
